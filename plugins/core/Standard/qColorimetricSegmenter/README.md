# Colorimetric Segmenter
This repository contains a plugin for Cloud Compare, developed as part of a transversal project with Polytech Nantes, the Graduate School of Engineering of the University of Nantes, and the company Taglabs. 
The purpose of the plugin is to perform color segmentation. 
The available filters are RGB, HSV and scalar value filtering.

## Thanks
The project was supervised by Mr. Nicolas Normand, professor and researcher at the University of Nantes, and Mr. Yan Koch, founder of the Taglabs company, whom we thank for their follow-up throughout the project.
We also thank Daniel Girardeau-Montaut, creator of Cloud Compare, for his precious help during the realization of the project.
